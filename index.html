    <p><strong>Aircraft Type:</strong> Douglas C-47A-25-DK (DC-3 in civilian form)</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Korangi Creek, Karachi (then part of British India, now Pakistan)</p>
    
    <p><strong>Crew Members:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Typically operated with 3 to 5 crew members, including a pilot, co-pilot, and possibly a flight engineer or radio operator.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Cause of the Accident:</strong> The aircraft was destroyed during its approach to land. The exact cause remains unclear, but possible contributing factors include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adverse Weather Conditions:</strong> Potential low visibility or coastal conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Pilot Error:</strong> Navigational challenges common at the time.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical Failure:</strong> Less common with the DC-3, but not impossible.</li>
    </ul>
